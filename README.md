**Color Detection in Real-Time**
This project detects a specific color (yellow) in real-time using a webcam feed. It uses OpenCV to process the video frames, convert them to HSV color space, and then apply a mask to detect the color. When the color is detected, a bounding box is drawn around the area where the color appears.
